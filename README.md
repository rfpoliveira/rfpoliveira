<h1 align="center">Get ready for the next battle!</h1>

I'm Renato, a passionate programming student with a strong will to learn more and do better. This all started as a side project on CS50 and quickly became aparent that was what I wanted to do with my carrer! 
With that objetive in mind I ran into 42 Porto is where I currently student pursuing a life in this challenging world of informatics but as more challeging it is the more reward it is because every puzzle, every battle makes us grow in fun and interesting different ways, line by line.

Currently enrolled at [42 Porto](https://www.42porto.com/pt/), a peer-to-peer academy where we learn in a really similar way to a future job, with group projects, rigorous projects and deadlines, responsability over the way we organize our work and in general a environment where we learn and taught at the same time all the time, developing crucial technical and soft skills to enter the job market really well prepared.

    About the School

    An innovative and tuition-free software engineering school. 
    It operates on a unique peer-to-peer, project-based learning model with no teachers or traditional classes. 
    The curriculum is gamified, encouraging  a "learn by doing" approach. The campus is open 24/7, 
    providing the flexibility to learn at my own pace.

    I'm developing strong technical skills in areas like C programming, C++, OOP, data structures and algorithms,
    and system administration. Beyond just coding, the collaborative nature of the school has helped me 
    cultivate essential soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and resilience. 
    I am constantly working on new projects that challenge me to think critically and adapt to real-world scenarios.
