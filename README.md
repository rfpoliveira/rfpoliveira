    I'm developing strong technical skills in areas like C programming, C++, data structures and algorithms,
    and system administration. Beyond just coding, the collaborative nature of the school has helped me 
    cultivate essential soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and resilience. 
    I am constantly working on new projects that challenge me to think critically and adapt to real-world scenarios.
