    About the School

    An innovative and tuition-free software engineering school. 
    It operates on a unique peer-to-peer, project-based learning model with no teachers or traditional classes. 
    The curriculum is gamified, encouraging  a "learn by doing" approach. The campus is open 24/7, 
    providing the flexibility to learn at my own pace.

    Skills I'm Learning

    I'm developing strong technical skills in areas like C programming, C++, data structures and algorithms, and system administration. 
    Beyond just coding, the collaborative nature of the school has helped me cultivate essential soft skills such as teamwork, 
    communication, problem-solving, and resilience. 
    I am constantly working on new projects that challenge me to think critically and adapt to real-world scenarios.
